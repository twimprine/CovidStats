# CovidStats

### One may ask why would we want another Covid tracker or stat analyzer or any other such nonsense? 

Because we can update, modify and change this so we create reports and such that aren't available elsewhere. 

### Why this one and not some other project? 

Because I'm asking nicely :) 

I know this isn't the best code anyone has seen but we all started somewhere doing something we thought was 
useful. This is my learning/useful project and if your would like to help out I would really appreciate the 
assistance in both the project and learning. 

## TODO

1 - I would like to add the cases per 100000 graphs 

2 - Create an index HTML page for static hosting on S3
